In these very uncertain times, it is very easy to get carried away by headlines and fake news found on social media websites that fit your narrative. That goes for both sides of the political spectrum, too. In my opinion, it is important to listen what the experts have to say and read the data provided by a credible source. Because data science deals with, well, data, the two actually go hand in hand. The rise of big data has allowed the covid researchers to study more data at a time which was impossible only a couple of decades ago. "Leaving aside any conspiracy theories about governmental cover-ups, the simple fact is that testing for coronavirus is expensive. This means that the numbers collected in a given country will be influenced by not only how widespread the virus actually is but also the financial ability for the local health care facilities to give the test to everyone who presents with concerns that theyâ€™re infected." Being able to study the virus on the massive scale that cloud computing allows for can actually save countries money because they will know where to place their resources in a more efficient manner. Even the graphs and charts that are presented on the news are made with the data collected from institutions and run through a predictive algorithm by a data scientist. This allows us to hopefully see what is to come and try to prevent it.
