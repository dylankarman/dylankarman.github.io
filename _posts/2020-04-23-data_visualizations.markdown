Before I started on my Data Science journey, I did not give two, you-know-what's, about graphs. I can't be the only one, right? The first thing that I noticed however, was that I already knew  many graph types, but I did not know what they were best suited for. I also did not know that graphs could be so visually appealing! (Thank you Seaborn!) What better way to express your raw data to someone that does not understand than with an easy to read and beautiful graph? Because of this new found respect, I wanted to share some of the common graph types that I have been using so far, and what they might be best suited for with your data. 

"A picture, so they say, will tell a thousand words. But what about a graph or chart? A good graph or chart can show as much as several paragraphs of words. But how do you choose which style of graph to use?"

As is often the case, I could not explain this better than somone smarter than me has already done on the internet. 

"Types of Charts
There are several different types of charts and graphs. The four most common are probably line graphs, bar graphs and histograms, pie charts, and Cartesian graphs. They are generally used for, and best for, quite different things.

You would use:

**Bar graphs** to show numbers that are independent of each other. Example data might include things like the number of people who preferred each of Chinese takeaways, Indian takeaways and fish and chips.
**Pie charts** to show you how a whole is divided into different parts. You might, for example, want to show how a budget had been spent on different items in a particular year.
**Line graphs** show you how numbers have changed over time. They are used when you have data that are connected, and to show trends, for example, average night time temperature in each month of the year.
**Cartesian graphs** have numbers on both axes, which therefore allow you to show how changes in one thing affect another. These are widely used in mathematics, and particularly in Algebra."

As someone that did not 'care' about graphs before, it was really an eye opening experience. It is so much easier to explain or understand data that is visually represented. This fact, coupled with the Seaborn visuals package, makes presentations a breeze.
