As my journey to become a data scientist is coming to an end, I am asking myself, "what is next?" Well, having no experience in the field before I started this bootcamp, it is probably very hard if not impossible to jump right in to data scientist. Instead, I think the best course of action is to start as a data analyst and become more comfortable with pandas and SQL. After a few years of that, your guess is as good as mine. Who knows, maybe ill become the next zuckerberg or gates in that time and I wont need to work anymore... HAHAH. "So youre saying theres a chance?!" The process of applying for and interviewing for jobs will be a daunting one but having gone throught the boot camp I can definitel handle that. Plus, my personality will be perfect to lighten up a boring office! Fingers crossed it doesnt take too long :).
