In 2012 I graduated from my university with a Bachelor's Degree in Criminal Justice with aspirations to become a police officer. After graduation I was only 20 and did not feel ready to begin my career. Basically, I knew that there was something I needed to do first, but I was not quite sure what that was. After becoming a bartender, the number one thing people told me was that they wish they had done more with their lives when they were younger, and I instantly became infatuated with the idea of travelling the world. What better thing to do when you're young than to travel the world and learn different cultures and languages? I set out in September 2015, in Norway, and 9 months later I ended up in Bali, Indonesia. At this place and moment in time, I happened to meet my future wife. After meeting her I ended up re evaluating my career choice to something safer and more condusive to family life. After speaking with my neighbor and friend from college about what I should do with my life, he mentioned coding bootcamps and how the demand is really high and only growing. After a little bit of research, I landed on becoming a Data Scientist. A couple of things that influenced this decision are, obviously the growth, which I saw estimated at 600% for the near future, the salary which is high and can easily aid in helping to grow my new family, and I really like working on projects which are a huge part of a Data Scientists job. As I progress in the Data Science field, I hope to someday use my Criminal Justice degree to help collect data on crime and try to help prevent future crime. 

Thank you,
