This is not something that is particularly hard, but for some things, it is very important. This is why Python has a built in Datetime function that, when implemented, allows Python to read the date and implement it in your code. 

In order to do this you must first import it. 

import datetime

Now you are free to call upon it whenever you may need. If you wanted to know what the date and time it is right at this moment, you can type: 

x = datetime.datetime.now()

There are many different things that you can do to change and edit the date and time depending on your time zone, etc. Some interesting documentation can be found here https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datetime.asp for further study.
